This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the app, where the app doesn't handle the deep link as intended.  The inconsistency makes it difficult to reliably determine whether a deep link was used to launch the app.
